<p>Population is increasing; land is decreasing, so it is very necessary to increase productivity of crops. Currently agriculture contributes roughly 17% of India's GDP which was 43% in 1970. In last 10 years, agricultural growth has been approximately 1.5% while India's GDP has grown over 7%.

There are number of websites, SMS services, and Agriculture centers available for agricultural news. Websites for farmers that'll give them practical advice on pesticides, fertilizers, soil types and easy ways to identify crop diseases, in all Indian languages.

<p>A comprehensive ICT strategy has, therefore, been developed not only to reach out to farmers in an easy and better way but also for planning and monitoring of schemes so that policy decisions can be taken at a faster pace and farmers can be benefited quickly. To empower different sections of rural areas, different ICT strategies have been devised:
Agricultural websites, apps, SMS facilities and call centers in India help farmers and individuals get updated on latest farming practices, Agriculture news, Government schemes, and quick access to farming machinery dealers nearby. Earlier, due to a lack of knowledge, farmers weren’t able to bring more yields to their farms. Moreover, but now, with these top agriculture apps in India, farmers can now improve their farming practices, have options for reviewing the latest farming implements of choice and know what weather condition or fertiliser type is best suited for their soil.</p>
